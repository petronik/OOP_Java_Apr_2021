The photocopier is broken... 
Just as you were sneaking around the office to print off your favorite binary code!

Instead of copying the original, it reverses it: '1' becomes '0' and vice versa.

Given a string of binary, return the version the photocopier gives you as a string.

broken("1") => "0"
broken("10000000101101111110011001000") => "01111111010010000001100110111"
broken("100010") => "011101"
